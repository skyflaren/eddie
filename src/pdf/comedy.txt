FADE IN:

EXT. PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND - WINTER MORNING

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN is standing on the street corner waiting
for a bus. She's carrying books and looking very collegiate.

A black stretch LIMOUSINE with darkened windows drives past,
SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, and backs up. The Young Woman stares at
her reflection in the windows, wondering what this is all
about.

Finally, the REAR PASSENGER WINDOW zips down, revealing LLOYD
CHRISTMAS, age 30. He's a pleasant-enough looking guy, if a
little shaggy. He's wearing a dark suit.

                       LLOYD
           Excuse me, can you tell me how to
           get to the medical school? I'm
           supposed to be giving a lecture in
           twenty minutes and my driver's a bit
           lost.

                       YOUNG WOMAN
               (heavy European accent)
           Go straight aheads and makes a left
           over za bridge.

Lloyd checks out her body.

                       LLOYD
           I couldn't help noticing the accent.
           You from Jersey?

                       YOUNG WOMAN
               (unimpressed)
           Austria.

                       LLOYD
           Austria? You're kidding.
               (mock-Australian accent)
           Well, g'day, mate. What do you say
           we get together later and throw a
           few shrimp on the barbie.

The Young Woman turns her back to him and walks away.

                       LLOYD (CONT'D)
               (to self)
           Guess I won't be going Down Under
           tonight...

He SIGHS and zips the window back up.

                                                            2.

INT. LIMO

Lloyd climbs through the driver's partition into the front
seat. Then he puts a CHAUFFEUR'S CAP on his head and drives
away. We see that HE'S THE DRIVER!

The dispatch radio CRACKLES TO LIFE:

                        DISPATCHER
                (v.o.)
            Carr 22, come in, car 22...

Lloyd grabs his CB mike.

                          LLOYD
            This is 22.

                        DISPATCHER
            22, where the hell are you, Lloyd?
            You're running late on the East Side
            pick-up.

                        LLOYD
            Cool your jets, Arnie. I'm on my
            way.

                        DISPATCHER
                (v.o.)
            Well hurry it up. And make sure you
            park legally. One more ticket and
            your ass is history.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. MUTT CUTS DOG SALON - DAY
This building is white with black spots on it, like a
DALMATION. Over the front door is an awning shaped like a
DOG'S SNOUT, whiskers included. A van pulls up outside.

The vehicle is decorated like a GIANT POODLE, with four legs
hanging off the sides, a tail in the rear, and a dog's snout
on the front grill. MUTT CUTS is written on the side of it.

HARRY DUNNE climbs out. He's in his early 30s and dressed in
a ridiculous BEAGLE COSTUME, including a CAP WITH FLOPPY
EARS. He goes to the rear of the van, opens it, and a swarm
of DOGS pile out.

                        HARRY
            Okay, gang, single file. You know
            the rules: No pushing, no humping,
            and no sniffing heinies...

                                                           3.

The door to the shop opens and Harry's annoyed boss, MR.
PALMER, sticks his head out.

                      PALMER
          Hey, why aren't those mutts on
          leashes?

                      HARRY
          The same reason you're not on a leash,
          sir because it's demeaning and it
          chafes like hell.

                      PALMER
          Just get them in here now! They all
          have to be bathed and clipped in an
          hour.

Palmer disappears back inside. Harry CALLS to the dogs but
they pay no attention. He struggles to keep them from
wandering off. He grabs a couple of SMALL POOCHES and sits
them on a wall.

                      HARRY
          You kids stay right here...

As he turns to round up the other, we discover that the wall
isn't a wall it's a flatbed truck. The truck drives away,
taking the two dogs with it.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
              (at truck)
          Hey, wait a minute!

Harry chases after the vehicle.

                                                     CUT TO:
EXT. EAST SIDE ESTATE - DAY

Lloyd Christmas pulls the limousine into a long, tree-lined
driveway. He gets out and looks up in awe at an IMPRESSIVE
STONE MANSION. He WHISTLES to himself, then walks to the
front oor and RINGS THE BELL.

The double-front doors of the mansion open and MARY SWANSON
appears. She's 25 and gorgeous. Lloyd's jaw drops open when
he lays eyes on her.

                      MARY
          Hello.
              (beat)
          I'll be just a minute...

                                                          4.

As Mary steps back inside, Lloyd takes out a tiny can of
Binaca. He sprays his mouth, under his arms, his hair, behind
his ears...

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. LIMO - DAY

Lloyd is driving and Mary is in the back, looking out the
window, lost in thought. She's got a BRIEFCASE resting on
her lap and she fingers the leather nervously. Lloyd keeps
glancing at her in the rear-view mirror, but for a moment he
is speechless. Then:

                      LLOYD
          Why you going to the airport? Flying
          somewhere?

                      MARY
              (dead-pan)
          How'd you guess?

                      LLOYD
          Well, I saw your luggage, then when
          I noticed the airline ticket, I put
          two and two together.
              (beat)
          So where you heading?

                      MARY
          Aspen.

                      LLOYD
          Oh, you're gonna love it. I hear
          California's beautiful this time of
          year.
Mary looks back out the window and Lloyd sneaks another
glance.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Name's Christmas. Lloyd Christmas.

                      MARY
          I'm Mary.

ON LLOYD - we can almost see his mind work. He's desperate
to impress her.

                      LLOYD
          Uh, this isn't my real job, you know.
          It's only temporary.

                                                         5.

                         MARY
          Oh?

                      LLOYD
          Yeah, you see, my friend Harry and I
          are saving up our money so we can
          open our own pet store.

                         MARY
          That's nice.

                       LLOYD
              (smiling)
          I got worms.

                      MARY
          I beg your pardon?

                      LLOYD
          That's what we're gonna call it: I
          Got Worms. We're gonna specialize in
          selling worm farms you know, like
          ant farms. A lot of people don't
          realize that worms make much better
          pets than ants. They're quiet,
          affectionate, they don't bite, and
          they're super with the kids.

                      MARY
          Aren't ants quiet, too?

Lloyd realizes she has a point.

                        LLOYD
          Uh... well, sure but they aren't half
          as affectionate. And if you cut an
          ant's head off, it won't grow back.

                         MARY
          I see.

                      LLOYD
          And best of all, worm farming is a
          seventy-five-thousand-dollar-a-year
          industry. I wouldn't mind having a
          piece of that pie, if you know what
          I mean.

To her credit, she doesn't. They continue driving. Mary looks
at her watch and crosses her legs. Lloyd can see that she's
concerned about something.

                                                            6.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          What's the matter? Little tense about
          the flight?

                      MARY
              (beat)
          Something like that.

Lloyd SWIVELS AROUND and STARES over his shoulder at her.

                      LLOYD
          It's really nothing to worry about,
          Mary. Statistically, they say you're
          more likely to get killed on the way
          to the airport. You know, like in a
          head-on crash, or something.

                      MARY
          Um, Lloyd, could please keep your
          eyes on the road.

                      LLOYD
          Good thinking. There's a lot of bad
          rivers out there.

Lloyd turns back to the steering wheel.

                                                     CUT TO:

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Lloyd is putting the last bags on a cart. He closes the trunk
and turns to Mary. She looks nervous and disconcerted as she
reaches into her purse. She pulls out a ten-dollar tip.

                         MARY
          Here you go.

                      LLOYD
          Keep it. It was my pleasure.

For the first time, Mary Swanson offers a slight smile. This
makes her more lovely than ever.

                      LLOYD (CONT'D)
          Relax, Mary. Just get trashed and
          pass out. You'll be there before you
          know it.

                      MARY
          Thanks Lloyd.
              (beat)
          And good luck with your worms.

                                                            7.

Then she PICKS UP HER BRIEFCASE and walks into the terminal,
followed by a PORTER pushing her bags. Lloyd watches her,
ENCHANTED, until she's out of sight.

Afterwards, he climbs back into the limo,  LOVESICK. For a
moment he doesn't even have the energy to  turn the key. He
just drops his head against the steering  wheel, DEVASTATED.
There's a TAP on the window. Lloyd looks  up to see a POLICE
OFFICER standing there.

                      POLICE OFFICER
          Come on, move it, you're in a red
          zone.

Lloyd starts the limo and pulls away.

                                                      CUT TO:

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Mary looks tense as she moves through the throngs of
travelers. Her pace is slow, deliberate, and her eyes are
focused straight ahead.

She passes a row of phone botths and two MEN one dressed in
an ARMANI SUIT, the other in a PLAID SPORTCOAT watch her.

                       ARMANI SUIT
          She's gonna leave the briefcase at
          the foot of the escalator. You make
          the pick-up.

                      PLAID SPORTCOAT
          Piece of cake.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
As Lloyd pulls his limo slowly away, he glances in the airport
window and SEES MARY

WALKING ALONG.

When she stops at the foot of the escalator, he stops, too.
She puts down the briefcase and checks her coat pocket for
her ticket. Lloyd's attention is distracted by a HONK. He
turns to see a car irectly behind him.

                      LLOYD
              (to car's driver)
          Drive around me, you pinhead!

When he turns back to watch Mary in the terminal he sees
that SHE'S GONE, and she's LEFT HER BRIEFCASE AT THE FOOT OF
THE STAIRS. Lloyd jumps to ATTENTION.

                                                           8.

He pulls the car into a HANDICAPPED SPOT and hops out. He
starts to run into the terminal, then notices the Police
Officer and suddenly goes into a spastic walk, limping and
dragging him leg behind him like a palsy victim.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

The Armani Man nods to the Plaid Sportcoat and he starts to
approach the briefcase. Just as Plaid Sportcoat is reaching
for the handle, LLOYD RUNS BY AND GRABS IT. He CONTINUES UP
THE ESCALATOR three steps at a time. The two men look at
each other, dumbstruck.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - BOARDING GATE

Lloyd runs with the briefcase to the TV monitors that post
the departure times. He looks frantically at the confusion
of numbers.

                        LLOYD
          Damn!

QUICK CUT of a dejected Lloyd looking out the window as he
watches as Mary's airplane taxiing away.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Lloyd comes out with the briefcase, passing the two men, who
FOLLOW HIM AT A DISTANCE. He starts walking down the sidewalk
when suddenly he STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

HIS POV - his limo is being towed away    under the supervision
of the Police Officer.

He takes off after it, but to no avail.
                      LLOYD
          You can't do this! I'll lose my job!

As Lloyd watches the limo get towed out of site, he runs his
fingers through his hair.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - AFTERNOON

We see the Mutt Cuts van pull up and park at the curb. A
dejected Harry climbs out. At the same time, a taxi pulls up
and drops off Lloyd. (He's clutching Mary Swanson's
briefcase.) Both he and Harry climb the steps of the building.
They disappear inside without acknowledging each other.

                                                            9.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET - a black Cadillac pulls up
and parks. Inside are the Armani suit and the Sportcoat.
They are J.P. SHAY and JOSEPH MENTALINO (aka JOE
